# Smart Converter

A clean and fun command-line tool for my CS50P Final Project that packs several useful features into one app:

- Unit conversion (Length, Weight, Temperature)
- Prime number checker
- Quadratic equation solver (ax² + bx + c = 0 – handles real and complex roots)
- Conversion history (saves the last 20 conversions in a JSON file)

The interface uses the `rich` library to make the terminal look colorful, modern, and easy to use.

## Features

- Simple interactive menu
- Accurate unit conversions
- Fast prime number checking
- Complete quadratic formula solver
- Automatically saves and shows recent conversions
- Clean, well-commented code with good error handling

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install the only required library:
   ```bash
   pip install rich
